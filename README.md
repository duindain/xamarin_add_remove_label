Demonstration of a bug in Xamarin Forms 4.6.0.847 and 4.5.0

If you add a label to a vertical stack layout programatically then remove it then readd setting the stacklayout to IsVisible false each time when it has no children

On the second add the stacklayout is set to visible, it does have a child label but the contents are still invisible

There was a similiar bug in GTK https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/3665 this one has a work around to add a HeightRequest to the label but this does not work here

This bug is present in both Android and iOS

To reproduce the bug;
  run the solution
  Click the Add label button
    Label and stacklayout are correctly shown
  Click the remove label button
    Label is removed from stacklayout 
    As there are no children the stacklayout is set to IsVisible false correctly
  Click the Add Label button
    Label is added to stacklayout
    Stacklayout is set to IsVisible true
    Stacklayout is shown
    Label is not shown

Workaround:

Set the stacklayout to IsVisible true before adding the dynamic content and the content will be correctly shown
